    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 cups marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 (15-ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef to the skillet and cook until browned. Drain any excess fat. Stir in the marinara sauce and season with salt and pepper. Simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese with the egg. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Place 3 lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread one-third of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by one-third of the mozzarella cheese. Spoon a layer of meat sauce over the cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers two more times, ending with a layer of meat sauce. Sprinkle the top with grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 20 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna cool for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
