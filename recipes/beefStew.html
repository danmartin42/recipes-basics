    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A hearty beef stew featuring tender chunks of beef simmered with carrots, potatoes, and aromatic herbs in a rich beef broth. This cozy and satisfying stew is perfect for cold days and offers a flavorful blend of beef, vegetables, and optional red wine for extra depth. Itâ€™s finished with a thickened sauce for a comforting meal.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds beef chuck, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>4 carrots, peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>3 potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>3 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>1 cup red wine (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour (optional, for thickening)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the beef cubes to the pot and brown them on all sides. You may need to do this in batches to avoid overcrowding the pot. Once browned, remove the beef and set it aside.</li>
        <li>In the same pot, add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Return the browned beef to the pot. Stir in the tomato paste, then add the beef broth, red wine (if using), thyme, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Add the carrots and potatoes to the pot. Continue to simmer, covered, for an additional 30 minutes, or until the vegetables and beef are tender.</li>
        <li>If you prefer a thicker stew, mix 2 tablespoons of flour with 2 tablespoons of water to make a slurry. Stir the slurry into the stew and cook for an additional 5 minutes, or until thickened.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove the bay leaf before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
